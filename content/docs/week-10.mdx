# Practical Cloud Computing with AWS

## Week Ten

This week covers AWS security services that help protect your infrastructure and data.

---

## AWS GuardDuty

GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to protect your AWS accounts, workloads, and data stored in S3.

### Key Features

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Uses machine learning, anomaly detection, and integrated threat intelligence
- **Multiple Data Sources**: Analyzes events from various AWS services
- **Threat Detection**: Identifies potential security issues automatically

### Example Inputs of Data

- **CloudTrail Events Logs**: Unusual API calls, unauthorized deployments
- **VPC Flow Logs**: Unusual internal traffic, unusual IP addresses
- **DNS Logs**: Compromised EC2 instances sending embedded data within DNS queries
- **Others**: Lambda, S3 Data Events, etc.

## AWS Inspector & Detective

### AWS Inspector

Inspector allows for automated security assessments of EC2 instances, container images, and Lambda functions.

**Features:**

- Can also do continuous scanning of the infrastructure only when needed for package vulnerabilities
- Attaches a risk score for prioritization of issues within the security
- Sends data to Event Bridge

### AWS Detective

Detective analyzes data to determine root cause of security issue or suspicious activity using ML and graphs.

**Features:**

- Automatically takes data from VPC flow logs, CloudTrail, GuardDuty
- Produces visualizations with context to help you trace the root issue

---

## AWS Security Hub & Macie

### Security Hub

Central hub to manage security across several AWS accounts and automate security checks.

**Features:**

- Has integrated dashboards showing current security compliance status across all the services
- Aggregates findings from multiple AWS security services
- Provides a comprehensive view of your security posture

### Macie

Similar to GuardDuty and Detective, AWS Macie uses ML to discover and protect sensitive data stored in S3 buckets (data security).

**Features:**

- Automatically discovers sensitive data
- Provides data security insights
- Helps with compliance requirements

---

## AWS Certificate and Secrets Manager

### Certificate Manager

Used to easily provision, manage, and deploy (public & private) SSL/TLS certificates.

**Use Cases:**

- Used to provide encryption for data in-transit or (in-flight) for websites (HTTPS)
- Automatically renews certificates
- Free for public certificates

### Secrets Manager

Automatically generates secrets (passwords) on rotation on a set schedule (uses Lambda to rotate).

**Features:**

- Can be integrated with AWS RDS (Aurora, PostgreSQL, Oracle)
- Automatically rotates credentials
- Stores secrets securely with encryption

---

## AWS Artifact and Config

### AWS Config

Records and audits your AWS infrastructure for compliance by recording configurations and changes to resources over time.

**Features:**

- Continuous monitoring of resource configurations
- Compliance checking
- Configuration history and change tracking

### AWS Artifact

Portal that provides AWS customers with on-demand access to AWS compliance documentation and agreements.

**Artifact Reports:**

- Allows you to download security & compliance documentation from 3rd party auditors
- Examples: AWS ISO certs, Payment Card Industry (PCI), System and Organization Control (SOC) reports

**Artifact Agreements:**

- Allows you to track status of AWS agreements
- Examples: Business Associate Addendum (BAA) or Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for an individual account
