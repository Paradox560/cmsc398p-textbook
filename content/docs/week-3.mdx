# Practical Cloud Computing with AWS

## Week Three

This week introduces AWS compute services, focusing on Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) - the foundation of compute in AWS.

---

## What is EC2?

**Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)** is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows you to launch virtual servers (instances) on demand, configure security and networking, and manage storage.

### Key Benefits

- **Elastic**: Scale capacity up or down based on demand
- **Flexible**: Choose instance types, operating systems, and software
- **Cost-effective**: Pay only for what you use
- **Secure**: Built-in security features and network isolation

## EC2 Instance Types

EC2 instances are optimized for different use cases. Instance types are named based on their family, generation, and size.

### Instance Families

- **General Purpose**: Balanced compute, memory, and networking (t3, t4g, m5, m6i)
- **Compute Optimized**: High-performance processors (c5, c6i)
- **Memory Optimized**: High memory-to-vCPU ratio (r5, r6i, x1e)
- **Storage Optimized**: High, sequential read/write access (i3, d2)
- **Accelerated Computing**: Hardware accelerators (p3, p4, g4)

### Instance Naming Convention

Example: `m5.large`

- **m** = Instance family (General Purpose)
- **5** = Generation
- **large** = Instance size

## Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)

An **AMI** is a template that contains the software configuration (operating system, application server, and applications) required to launch an instance.

### AMI Types

- **Public AMIs**: Provided by AWS or the community
- **Private AMIs**: Your own custom AMIs
- **AWS Marketplace AMIs**: Pre-configured software stacks

### AMI Components

- Root volume template (OS, applications)
- Launch permissions
- Block device mapping

---

## Security Groups

**Security Groups** act as virtual firewalls for your EC2 instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic.

### Key Features

- **Stateful**: If you allow inbound traffic, outbound traffic is automatically allowed
- **Default Deny**: All inbound traffic is denied by default
- **Multiple Rules**: Can have multiple rules per security group
- **Multiple Groups**: Instances can belong to multiple security groups

### Common Rules

- **SSH (Port 22)**: For Linux instances
- **RDP (Port 3389)**: For Windows instances
- **HTTP (Port 80)**: For web traffic
- **HTTPS (Port 443)**: For secure web traffic

---

## Key Pairs

**Key Pairs** are used to securely connect to your EC2 instances.

### How It Works

1. Create a key pair in AWS (or import your own)
2. AWS stores the public key
3. You download and securely store the private key
4. Use the private key to SSH into Linux instances or decrypt Windows passwords

### Best Practices

- Never share your private key
- Use different key pairs for different environments
- Rotate keys regularly
- Store private keys securely

---

## EC2 Instance Lifecycle

Understanding the instance lifecycle helps you manage costs and availability.

### Instance States

- **Pending**: Instance is being launched
- **Running**: Instance is running and ready to use
- **Stopping**: Instance is being stopped
- **Stopped**: Instance is stopped (you're charged for storage)
- **Shutting-down**: Instance is being terminated
- **Terminated**: Instance is permanently deleted

### Stop vs Terminate

- **Stop**: Instance can be restarted later (data on EBS volumes is preserved)
- **Terminate**: Instance is permanently deleted (default EBS volumes are deleted)

---

## Elastic IP Addresses

An **Elastic IP** is a static, public IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing.

### Use Cases

- When you need a persistent public IP
- When you need to mask instance failures
- For applications that require a stable IP

### Important Notes

- Elastic IPs are free when attached to running instances
- You're charged if an Elastic IP is not attached to a running instance
- Limit of 5 Elastic IPs per region by default

---

## EC2 Placement Groups

Placement groups influence the placement of instances to meet specific requirements.

### Types

1. **Cluster**: Low latency, high throughput (same AZ)
2. **Spread**: Reduces risk of simultaneous failures (different hardware)
3. **Partition**: For large distributed and replicated workloads

---

## EC2 Auto Scaling

**Auto Scaling** helps you maintain application availability and scale capacity automatically.

### Benefits

- **Availability**: Automatically replace unhealthy instances
- **Cost Optimization**: Scale down during low demand
- **Performance**: Scale up during high demand

### Components

- **Launch Template/Configuration**: Defines what to launch
- **Auto Scaling Group**: Defines where and how many
- **Scaling Policies**: Defines when to scale

---

## EC2 Best Practices

1. **Right-size instances**: Choose appropriate instance types
2. **Use Reserved Instances**: For predictable workloads (save up to 75%)
3. **Enable CloudWatch**: Monitor instance performance
4. **Use Security Groups**: Control network access
5. **Tag instances**: For organization and cost tracking
6. **Use IAM roles**: Instead of storing credentials on instances
7. **Regular backups**: Use snapshots for EBS volumes

## Next Class Preview

In Week 4, we'll cover AWS storage services including S3, EBS, and EFS.

## Key Takeaways

1. EC2 provides scalable compute capacity in the cloud
2. Instance types are optimized for different workloads
3. AMIs are templates for launching instances
4. Security groups act as virtual firewalls
5. Key pairs enable secure access to instances
6. Auto Scaling helps maintain availability and optimize costs
7. Understanding instance lifecycle is crucial for cost management
