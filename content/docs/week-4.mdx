# Practical Cloud Computing with AWS

## Week Four

This week covers AWS storage services, with a focus on Simple Storage Service (S3), Elastic Block Store (EBS), and Elastic File System (EFS).

---

## AWS Storage Services Overview

AWS offers multiple storage services optimized for different use cases:

- **S3**: Object storage for any amount of data
- **EBS**: Block storage for EC2 instances
- **EFS**: Managed file storage for EC2 instances
- **Storage Gateway**: Hybrid cloud storage

---

## Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)

S3 is object storage built to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere.

### Key Features

- **Durability**: 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability
- **Availability**: 99.99% availability
- **Scalability**: Virtually unlimited storage
- **Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Cost-effective**: Pay only for what you use

### S3 Concepts

- **Buckets**: Containers for objects (like folders)
- **Objects**: Files stored in buckets
- **Keys**: Unique identifier for objects (like file path)
- **Regions**: Buckets are created in specific regions

### S3 Storage Classes

| Storage Class                     | Use Case                                 | Durability    | Availability |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| **S3 Standard**                   | Frequently accessed data                 | 99.999999999% | 99.99%       |
| **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**        | Unknown or changing access patterns      | 99.999999999% | 99.9%        |
| **S3 Standard-IA**                | Infrequently accessed data               | 99.999999999% | 99.9%        |
| **S3 One Zone-IA**                | Infrequently accessed, non-critical data | 99.5%         | 99.5%        |
| **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**  | Archive with instant access              | 99.999999999% | 99.9%        |
| **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval** | Archive with retrieval in minutes        | 99.999999999% | 99.99%       |
| **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**       | Long-term archive                        | 99.999999999% | 99.99%       |

### S3 Versioning

**Versioning** keeps multiple versions of an object in the same bucket.

- **Benefits**: Recover from accidental deletions or overwrites
- **Enabled at bucket level**: Applies to all objects
- **Each version has unique ID**: Can restore any version

### S3 Lifecycle Policies

Automatically transition objects between storage classes or delete them.

**Common Transitions:**

- Move to Standard-IA after 30 days
- Move to Glacier after 90 days
- Delete after 365 days

### S3 Security

- **Access Control**: Bucket policies, ACLs, IAM policies
- **Encryption**: Server-side encryption (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C)
- **MFA Delete**: Require MFA to delete objects
- **Access Logging**: Track access requests

### S3 Transfer Acceleration

Uses CloudFront edge locations to accelerate uploads to S3.

- **Benefits**: Faster uploads from anywhere in the world
- **Use Case**: Large file uploads from distant locations

## Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)

EBS provides persistent block storage volumes for use with EC2 instances.

### Key Features

- **Persistent**: Data persists independently of instance lifecycle
- **High Performance**: Low-latency, high-throughput storage
- **Scalable**: Resize volumes on the fly
- **Backup**: Create snapshots for backup and disaster recovery

### EBS Volume Types

| Volume Type | Use Case                       | Max IOPS | Max Throughput |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | -------- | -------------- |
| **gp3**     | General purpose (latest)       | 16,000   | 1,000 MB/s     |
| **gp2**     | General purpose                | 16,000   | 250 MB/s       |
| **io1**     | High-performance IOPS          | 64,000   | 4,000 MB/s     |
| **io2**     | High-performance IOPS (latest) | 256,000  | 4,000 MB/s     |
| **st1**     | Throughput-optimized           | 500      | 500 MB/s       |
| **sc1**     | Cold HDD                       | 250      | 250 MB/s       |

### EBS Snapshots

**Snapshots** are point-in-time backups of EBS volumes.

- **Incremental**: Only changed blocks are saved
- **Regional**: Snapshots are stored in S3 (region-specific)
- **Encrypted**: Can encrypt snapshots
- **Copy**: Can copy snapshots across regions

### EBS Best Practices

1. **Right-size volumes**: Match volume type to workload
2. **Use gp3**: Latest generation for cost savings
3. **Enable encryption**: For sensitive data
4. **Regular snapshots**: For backup and disaster recovery
5. **Monitor performance**: Use CloudWatch metrics

## Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)

EFS provides a simple, scalable, fully managed file system for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources.

### Key Features

- **Fully Managed**: No file server management
- **Scalable**: Automatically grows and shrinks
- **Shared Storage**: Multiple EC2 instances can access simultaneously
- **NFS Compatible**: Works with standard NFS clients

### EFS Performance Modes

- **General Purpose**: Low latency for most workloads
- **Max I/O**: Higher latency, higher throughput

### EFS Throughput Modes

- **Bursting**: Baseline throughput scales with file system size
- **Provisioned**: Set throughput independently of size

### EFS Storage Classes

- **Standard**: Frequently accessed files
- **Infrequent Access (EFS-IA)**: Cost-optimized for files not accessed every day

### Use Cases

- Content management systems
- Web serving
- Application development and testing
- Big data analytics
- Media processing workflows
