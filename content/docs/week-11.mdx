# Practical Cloud Computing with AWS

## Week Eleven - Global Architecture

This week covers tools and services for building global, scalable architectures on AWS.

---

## Overview of the Tools

This week covers:

- AWS CloudFormation
- AWS Beanstalk
- AWS CloudFront
- AWS Amplify
- AWS Global Accelerator
- AWS Outposts
- AWS SQS & SNS
- AWS Kinesis
- AWS Data Firehose

---

## AWS CloudFront

Taking the concept of caching, CloudFront improves data read performance by caching content at edge locations.

### Key Features

- **100s of Points of Presence (edge locations)**: Distributed globally
- **Automatic connection to AWS Shield & WAF**: Built-in DDoS protection
- **Popular backend links**: S3 Storage, Load Balancers, EC2 Instances, Custom HTTP site
- **Great for static content**: That needs to be low latency for regions globally
- **S3 Transfer Acceleration**: Data to S3 can be faster through edge locations (uses CloudFront network distribution)
- **Generally for**: Images, videos, websites (reason for using S3)

---

## AWS Global Accelerator

Uses the AWS Global Network to improve application availability and performance.

### Key Features

- **Optimizes networking path**: To application (60% improvement)
- **Similar to CloudFront**: Uses edge locations to make small efficient "jumps"
- **Unlike CloudFront**: However, it doesn't use caching
- **Uses TCP or UDP**: For the underlying layer 4 protocol
- **Good for**: HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses or fast regional failover

---

## AWS Elastic Beanstalk

Example of Platform as a Service (PaaS) in AWS.

### Key Features

- **Abstract the underlying infrastructure**: Only worry about code, similar to AWS Lambda
- **Have control of configuration**: Of which type of cloud deployment you want

### Three Architectural Models

1. **Single Instance**: Good for development environments
2. **Load Balancer + Auto Scaling Groups**: Great for production/pre-production web apps
3. **Auto Scaling Groups**: Great for non-web apps in production

**Health Monitoring**: Can be enabled in CloudWatch

---

## AWS CloudFormation

A structured document outlining the resources you want deployed in your infrastructure.

### Key Features

- **In a template**: You can choose to specify EC2 instances, VPC policies, S3 buckets, etc.
- **Executed in top-bottom order**: Exactly as written in the template configuration
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: CloudFormation is an example of Infrastructure as Code
- **Very similar to**: Products such as Terraform and Pulumi
- **Automation**: Can be enabled to see certain stacks deployed on a schedule
- **Resource management**: Resources created immediately from a configuration can be deleted from the CloudFormation all together at once
- **Infrastructure Composer**: Can be used to see all the resources and the relations between the components

---

## AWS SQS & SNS

### Simple Queue Service (SQS)

Fully managed (serverless) queue meant to decouple applications.

**Features:**

- **Consumers**: Can be AWS Lambda, EC2, any compute read messages in FIFO queue
- **Scaled Horizontally**: From 1 message per second to 10,000s per second & Low latency (< 10 ms on publish and receive)
- **Default retention**: Of messages: 4 days, maximum of 14 days
- **No limit**: To how many messages can be in the queue

### Simple Notification Service (SNS)

"Event Publishers" send messages to one SNS topic.

**Features:**

- **Each SNS topic has subscribers**: Which will receive any new notification
- **Up to 12,500,000 subscriptions**: Per topic, 100,000 topics limit
- **Pub/Sub model**: Publishers don't need to know about subscribers

---

## AWS Amplify

Essentially: It is Amazon's version of Firebase.

### Key Features

- **Backend as a Service (BaaS)**: A suite of services to handle all things backend
- **For user authentication**: AWS Amplify Cognito
- **For databases**: AWS AppSync with DynamoDB for Amplify
- **Handles**: API procurement & Hosting for web and mobile applications
- **Handles**: AI/ML, Monitoring, CI/CD, and anything else you would possibly need

---

## AWS Kinesis

Ingest, buffer, and process streaming data in real time to derive insights in minutes.

### Key Features

- **Fully managed**: By AWS and runs on serverless architecture
- **Handles streaming data**: From thousands of sources and processes it with low latency

### Video Streams

- Can ingest streaming data from millions of smartphones, security cameras, any other sensors
- Easily links with ML video recognition apps in AWS to process data

### Data Streams

- Accumulates data from millions of application logs: clicks, touch sensors, in-app events
- Combined with analytical tools, get results in seconds and can export results to S3

---

## AWS Outposts

Some companies maintain on-premises infrastructure along with cloud infrastructure (hybrid).

### Key Features

- **Outposts are "server racks"**: That offer AWS infrastructure, services, APIs to build apps on premises just as you would in the cloud
- **AWS will do the manual setup**: And manage the "racks"
- **Essentially**: Like having a mini piece of an AWS data center on premises
- **However**: You are responsible for physical security of the Outpost "rack"
